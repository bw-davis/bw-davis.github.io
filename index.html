            <p title="About Me">
                I am a self-motivated, highly professional individual who is seeking a career in web development.<br/><br/>
                After graduating high school and deciding I needed a change of scenery, I joined the U.S. Marine Corps as a helicopter crew chief on the Boeing CH-46E. When I re-enlisted, I transferred to the V-22 Osprey. I was blessed to be stationed in sunny San Diego when I wasn’t deployed or on a training assignment. More details about my experience in the service can be found on the “Marine Corps Career” page. After being honorably discharged in 2013, my family and I moved to Oregon to finish my schooling and begin my life as a civilian.<br/><br/>
                I have been married to my wife, Amanda Davis, for 7 years. We have two small dogs, Lucy and Leonard, and a horse, Sara. I currently live in Springfield, Oregon.

                <p>
                    I am currently a senior at the University of Oregon majoring in Computer and Information Science.
                    I started college while I was still in the Marine Corps taking courses at San Diego Community College.
                    After I was discharged I attended Lane Community College until I transferred to the U of O for my
                    junior year.  I have a cumulative G.P.A. of 3.61.

            <h2> High Order Calculator Grammar in C </h2>
                <p title="HOC Grammar">
                    I did a summer research project for the CIS Department Head at the U of O.  The goal was to take a chapter from
                    Kernighan and Pike's The Unix Programming Environment that covers  grammar and reformat the
                    code.  A lot has changed since the book was written in 1984 and there hasn't been any updates to the book.
                    Hence, the code in it's current form wouldn't compile or run properly.  The language created is called high order 
                    calculator but it in fact is fully functional, statically allocated, call by value language.  Here is a <a href="https://github.com/bw-davis/hoc/tree/master/hoc6" target="_blank">link</a> to the github repository.  The YACC grammar is in hoc.y and all of the other files I created to hold the supporting functions required for the language to operate.

            <h2> Student Athlete Mental Health </h2>
                <p title="Mental Health App">
                    Three friends and myself competed in the Hackathon 2016 competition and won in the category of Hack Harassment.  We made an iOS app for student athletes that would track their mood, level of activity, diet, sleep, etc. via a questionnaire.  They would take the survey every day and it would show them trends in their daily routine that equate to their overall mood being better.  The goal is to allow the athlete to be more in tune with their emotional well being and be able to create healthy habits.  Here is a <a href="https://github.com/bw-davis/hackathon2016/tree/master/Hackathon2016" target="_blank">link</a> to the github repository.

                <h2> Summary </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I joined the Marines in 2004 as a Boeing Ch-46E helicopter crew chief. As a crew chief, I was responsible for performing pre-flight inspections, ensuring the aircraft was safe to fly. During flight, I would man the weapons systems, assist pilots in navigation, safe flight operation, perform in-flight maintenance/testing, and load or unload cargo or passengers. When I wasn’t flying, I was busy managing and mentoring a crew of up to 40 junior Marines, ensuring maintenance tasks were being performed according to Quality Assurance standards, and troubleshooting complex aircraft systems. I often worked with other maintenance departments to coordinate maintenance and ensure squadron goals were being met. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was meritoriously promoted three times and attained the rank of Staff Sergeant    (E-6) far ahead of my peers. On an annual performance review, my direct superior wrote:
                    <blockquote>
                        <i>“I recommend that Sgt. Davis be considered for promotion ahead of contemporaries. A hard working and diligent NCO of the highest intelligence, Sgt. Davis has set the example that all other CH-46E crew chiefs should emulate … He is personally responsible for helping one of his Marines beat an alcohol addiction. His superior technical knowledge and unrelenting efforts helped ensure the health of the squadron and the proficiency of the Flightline Section. His drive for professional development goes far beyond that of his peers … Sgt. Davis represents the very best of the NCO ranks.” –Captain Jess Springfield</i>
